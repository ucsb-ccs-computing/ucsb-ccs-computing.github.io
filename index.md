The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Computing Program provides a small, tight-knit community of talented, passionate, self-directed learners in the context of a major research university. Our program provides well-prepared students an accelerated path through the "lower division" curriculum so that they can move quickly into advanced courses offered both in the CCS and the College of Engineeringâ€™s CS Department, which is one of the highest ranked CS departments in the nation. Our goal: early involvement of students in research and creative activity.
