# Resizing images with Imagemagick

The `convert` command line utility is available in the Imagemagick package,
which is available on CSIL, and can be [installed on Mac via homebrew](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7053996/how-do-i-install-imagemagick-with-homebrew)

To convert images of arbitrary size to 300 pixels of height, while maintaining aspect ration, use:

```
convert -resize x300 orig.jpg 300h.jpg
```

To convert images of arbitrary size to 50 pixels high, 

```
convert -resize x50 orig.jpg 50h.jpg
```
