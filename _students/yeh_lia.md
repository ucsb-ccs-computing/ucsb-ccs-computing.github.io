Lia is a first-year CCS Computing major, anticipating to double major in CCS Physics.  She is having fun experiencing mind-blowing moments in her Computing classes, as well as reinventing the way she sees physics.  A year ago, she would never have imagined that she would soon be writing a virtual machine from scratch with her fellow Computing freshmen, building her own cryptography library in C++, or studying abroad this summer at the University of Cambridge in England.  She likes playing club ultimate frisbee with the UCSB Burning Skirts team and volunteering at local middle schools with SciTrek.
