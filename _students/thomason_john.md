John Thomason is a 4th year CCS computer science student. He has worked
in the [Four Eyes Lab](https://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu/) under [Tobias Hollerer](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/) and
is first author on an [intelligent systems paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025179) written while studying
abroad in the [Takemura Lab](http://www.lab.ime.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/english/lab-introduction) at Osaka University. He finds
subjects such as virtual & augmented reality, computer vision, rendering,
and scientific computing to be highly interesting. He is enrolled in the
