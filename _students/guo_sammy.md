Sung-Yee ("Sammy") Guo is a 4th-year CCS Computer Science student.  He
works with [Prof. Tim Sherwood](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~sherwood) in
the [Archlab](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/) on novel processor
architectures.  He is a co-author on a paper about formally-verified
CPUs, cited below, in which a new CPU design was presented to help
programmers write bug-free code.

He also started a research project investigating ways to use novel CPU
designs to accelerate robotics applications.

His interests lie in embedded systems, computer architecture, and
robotics where he investigates ways to apply techniques in computer
science to improve performance in robot algorithms.
