Adam Schmidt is a 3rd-year CCS Computer Science major from Palo Alto, California (or Seattle, Washington--as of recent). 

Adam's academic interests lie mainly in the intersection of statistics, math, and computer vision--the more quantitative the better. Adam has held internships at two different companies in his time here--one programming FPGAS for filtering and processing real-time streaming data at a Synthetic Aperture Radar company, and another in prototyping new vision and calibration systems for a robotic surgical company (Intuitive Surgical). He is continuing his work as an intern on the Real-Time Vision team at Intuitive Surgical this coming summer.

Adam is conferring his degree at the end of this school year, and advancing on to UCSB's Masters program for Computer Science (combined BS/MS) next year.

Adam is also the president of UCSB's Climbing Team (which got second place at Regionals this year!!) When he is not programming, he is often either: climbing outside; or organizing funding, trips, and competitions for the team. Adam is also an avid reader (squeezing it in whenever he has a bit of down time).
