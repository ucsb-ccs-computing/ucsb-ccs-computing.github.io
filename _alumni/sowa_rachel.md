Rachel Sowa is a 2017 graduate of the CCS Computer Science program, originally from Livermore, California. Her interests include applications of Computer Science to music and media arts, including making electronic musical instruments and multicolored LED interfaces with Arduino and Max/MSP. Studying in CCS gave her the opportunity to take courses in the Media Arts and Technology graduate program at UCSB and explore topics such as sound synthesis, media signal processing, and audiovisual performance. During the summer of 2015, she interned at Sonos in downtown Santa Barbara, where she worked on developing a platform to test state transitions in the speakers’ setup wizard software. In addition to studying Computer Science, Rachel also double minored in Music and German. She played in the UCSB Horn Studio and studied French horn with Dr. Steven Gross. Through the UCSB Education Abroad Program, she spent the summer of 2016 in Berlin, Germany, taking classes in social media and business innovation management at the Technische Universität Berlin.

Rachel now lives in Seattle and works as a full-time software engineer for Sonos. During her free time, she enjoys tinkering around with Arduino sensors, reading, and exploring her new surroundings in the Pacific North West.
