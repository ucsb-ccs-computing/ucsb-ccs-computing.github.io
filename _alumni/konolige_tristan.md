I'm working on my Ph.D. at University of Colorado Boulder. My focus is on large
scale parallel solvers for graph Laplacian systems (what a mouthful). I also
dabble in programming languages and computer graphics/animation.

I spend a lot of my time in Colorado skiing, kayaking or climbing. It
surprising that I actually get research done.
