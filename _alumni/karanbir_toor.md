I graduated in 2013 with a degree in Physics and Computer Science. Joining CCS
was easily one of the best decisions I made in my life. The flexible curriculum
and individualized attention gave me an education custom made for my interests
and ambitions. The small classes gave me an ideal environment for learning.
Lastly, CCS gave me a great network to leverage and the best of friends.

Now I work for [AdStage][adstage], a startup in San Francisco, and enjoy [blogging][blog] about
Lisp.
