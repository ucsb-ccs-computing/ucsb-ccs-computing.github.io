I am a first-year PhD student in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC San Diego](http://cse.ucsd.edu/).  My advisor is [Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/).

In September 2016, I received my Master degree in Computer Science at UCSB, advised by [Stefano Tessaro](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~tessaro/). In December 2015, I graduated from the College of Creative Studies with B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Mathematics.

In Summer 2014, I completed a summer research project titled [Edwards Curves and Hybrid Pseudorandom Number Generators](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~weidai/files/2014/SURF-poster.pdf), advised by [Omer Egecioglu](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~omer/) and [Cetin Kaya Koc](http://koclab.cs.ucsb.edu/koc.html), and supported by a [UCSB CCS SURF fellowship](https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/creative-activity/surf-program-0).
