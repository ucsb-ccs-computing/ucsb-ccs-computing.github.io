I'm currently a Software Engineer 2 at [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/), a biotech company in
San Diego. When I was a CCS student, I really enjoyed working in an
interdisciplinary environment, one where I could walk into a room and
be pulled into a discussion on anything from physics, to biology, to
art. When I was applying to jobs in my final year, I realized that I
really wanted to keep that spirit of learning alive. Because of this I
applied to Illumina where now I am work with gene sequencers, so
everyday I get to hear something new about the biology, chemistry, and
physics behind sequencing.

CCS really prepares its students to be proactive in seeking research
opportunities, which led me to a very fun research project. While I
was on study abroad in England I created a device that could control
your fingers using electrical stimulation of the muscles in your
arm. Using this device I researched teaching with haptic feedback by
moving my participants' fingers on a new keyboard design. In addition
to giving me my Mad Scientist merit badge, I also discovered how much
I enjoy programming for objects that exist in the physical world.
