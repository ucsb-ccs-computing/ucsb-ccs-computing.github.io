I'm currently a Master's Student in the [Stanford Computer Science 
Department](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/), focusing on Machine Learning. Originally I entered
UC Santa Barbara as a Econ/Accounting major, but because I had
an interest in computer science, I wanted to be a part of both
majors, so I applied to CCS. With the immense amount of support
from advisors in both the [UCSB Economics Department](https://econ.ucsb.edu/) as well as the 
CCS Computing program, I was able to graduate in four
years with a double major while also doing 2 years of undergraduate
research.

Out of all of the communities that I was a part of, I feel like CCS
was the most important. I had a close-knit group of advisors and staff
like [Phill Conrad](/faculty/conrad_phill), and [Tim Sherwood](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~sherwood/), alumni mentors/friends such as [Doug Thift](/alumni/thrift_doug) and Jay Freeman, as well as a talented group of CCS peers in
classrooms and labs. During my junior and senior year of undergrad, 
I was also the lead developer of
[PyRTL](https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL) in the [Arch Lab](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~arch/)
at UCSB, researching and developing improved ways for describing
flow graphs for hardware. Despite my changing interests, 
the education at CCS has given me the research
experience that will benifit me for a lifetime.
