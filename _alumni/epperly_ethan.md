Ethan Epperly is a graduate student in [Applied and Computational Mathematics at Caltech](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_acm) and a [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf/news-events/2020-incoming-class). Ethan graduated from UCSB in 2020 with two majors in CCS Computing and CCS Mathematics.  His interests are in [computational modelling of structural materials](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2020.103944), [fast algorithms for structured linear systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05858), and data science. While at UCSB, Ethan worked for five summers at [Sandia National Labs](http://www.sandia.gov) working with [Dr. Ryan Sills](https://mse.rutgers.edu/fac/ryan-sills) and did research with the [UCSB Scientific Computing Group](http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu). Ethan was recognized for his academic work as one of [41 finalists for the competitive Hertz foundation fellowship](https://hertzfoundation.org/news/pressrelease/1532/41-Finalists-Named-for-the-2019-Hertz-Fellowships) and received an offer for a [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/news/2020/2020-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships-awarded) which he turned down to accept the DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship. Ethan was recognized for his research at UCSB with the [Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2020/019934/charts). When he is not writing code or proving martingale inequalities, Ethan can be found listening to music or playing board games.
