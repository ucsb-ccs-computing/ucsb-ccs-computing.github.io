Kyle Klein is a Technical Lead and Manager for the Google Drive
Backend Business Logic Team in Boulder Colorado. Kyle graduated from
CCS with a degree in Computer Science in 2010. During the last year of
his undergrad Kyle starting working on research problems applying
Computational Geometry to Pursuit Evasion with [Prof. Subhash Suri](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/). This led directly to becoming a Ph.D. student in Prof. Suri's
lab where Kyle continued his work studying Pursuit Evasion games in a
wide variety of geometric models. Kyle completed his Ph.D. in 2014
with a thesis titled, Geometric Pursuit Evasion.

Kyle escaped the Silicon Valley crowd after 2 years and lives happily
with his wife, two dogs, and two cats in a small town outside Boulder
in Colorado. He enjoys woodworking, spending time hiking in the
beautiful Colorado mountains, and continuing his quest to visit all
the Breweries in Colorado. The last of which is a daunting task as
they appear to be opening faster than he can visit them.
