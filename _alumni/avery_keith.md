I transferred into CCS Computer Science from [Santa Barbara City College](https://www.sbcc.edu) in 2011. After graduating, I stayed at UCSB and completed a Master's Degree. During that time, I was a TA for several CoE CS courses including CS 160: Translation of Programming Languages and CS 16: Problem Solving with Computers II.

After UCSB I moved to the Bay Area and am working on the Health & Fitness features of the Apple Watch.
