I’m now a PhD student in the [PLSE](http://uwplse.org/) group at the University of Washington advised
by [Zach Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/).

I came to UCSB undeclared, and worked my way into CCS after a year at UCSB. During my time at UCSB
I became interested in programming languages, and spent many of my free hours writing toy languages.
Before beginning my PhD I was a member of UCSB's PL Lab and ArchLab. I taught multiple courses in CCS,
wrote papers, helped design and teach CS 162, as well as the graduate program analysis course.
I found CCS to be a perfect environment to grow from an undeclared student into an experienced programmer
 and computer scientist.

CCS gave me the tools to become effective quickly, allowing me to be able to contribute in
meaningful ways during my undergraduate years. I worked at multiple local startups as well as contributing
heavily to the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) programming language, including a summer at
Mozilla Research working on the language.
Most recently I have been a member of the [RiSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-in-software-engineering-rise/)
group at Microsoft Research working on two experimental programming languages [F*](https://fstar-lang.org) and
[Lean](http://leanprover.github.io).

Most importantly I had the amazing fortune of being able to call many peer in CCS friends,
mentors, or mentees, and many all three. I learned about the commonalities of being a passionate and
excited member of field, regardless of whether it was art, literature, music, physics, math or
computer science. I found this experience to be one of the most unique and rewarding parts of CCS,
it goes quickly, make sure to enjoy!
