Phill Conrad joined the UCSB faculty in 2007, and divides his time evenly between the College of Creative Studies Computing Program, and the Department of Computer Science in the College of Engineering.

His main area of concentration is undergraduate teaching and
curriculum.  His research focus is improving instruction to increase
learning, motivation, recruiting and retention in Computer Science.
He is particularly interested in finding ways to bridge the gap
between programming as an academic exercise, and software development
as it is practiced in industry and research settings.

Phill completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of
Delaware], with a specialization in protocol design for streaming
multimedia.  He taught at Temple University in Philadelphia and at the
University of Delaware before joining the UCSB faculty.

Phill also has an interest in music--he plays piano and guitar, and participates in a community chorus.  He co-taught a class with CCS faculty member Leslie Hogan titled [Sound, Image and Computation] that used computer programming to combind sounds and images to create new works of art.
