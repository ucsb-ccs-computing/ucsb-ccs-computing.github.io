  <h2>Publications by CCS Computing Students</h2>
  <p>CCS student authors are in bold.   Publications should appear in this list only if the student's contribution to the publication was made as an undergrad.  Work that started while the student was an undergrad and continued into the 5-year combined BS/MS program may be included, but not work done as a Ph.D. student or after graduating from UCSB.</p>
